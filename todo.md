# TODO

A number of features have been introduced to PHP and the community since I
left it back in 2012 so I am probably out of touch with best practices. Any
help and guidance is appreciated.

- use namespaces?
- put it on a package manager (composer/packagist)
- replace cURL?

	How well is support? Is there a better alternative?

- add methods

	All supported API methods should be added (see
	https://github.com/paylike/node-api and
	https://github.com/paylike/api-docs for a reference)
